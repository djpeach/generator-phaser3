# Phaser 3 Generator

This is another generator for Phaser 3 games. This one does not force you to use yarn or Typescript, and lets you add those later on your own if you wish. 

It does come with electron support (just run `npm run app`), and is ready to be built and deployed to github pages (run `npm run build`, then setup gh pages to source from `./docs`)
